# AlgorithmsAndDataStructures

This is the collection of assignments submitted for my Algorithms and Data Structures for Engineers class.

## Homework 1
This consists of two parts. The first part takes a file with binary numbers (up to 32-bits each) that are separated by carriage returns and the main function returns the decimal sum of the binary numbers. The second part returns the string that is the most frequent occurring string of the size inputted.

## Homework 2
This assignment provides a solution to find the sum that is closest to 330, found by adding up to three integers in the array.

## Homework 3
This is the creation of a class to use to store and carry out operations on either strings of numbers or integers in order for them to behave in predictable ways.

## Homework 4
This function and related files takes a linked list and sorts it using merge sort.

## Homework 5
This adds the pieces of the class together.
